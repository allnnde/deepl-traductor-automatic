The target instinctively knows which action will trigger the omen and can ward off the omen by spending a total of 3 actions, which have the concentrate trait, to pray, make signs against doom, or similar apotropaic actions. These actions need not be consecutive. After the creature spends the actions, the spell ends.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The damage increases by 10.</p>","/entries/Suspended Retribution/target:1 creature","/entries/Swallow Light/name:Swallow Light","/entries/Swallow Light/description:<p>You draw magical light into your open mouth, consuming it and turning its essence into fuel for a gout of life-draining shadows.

Sweetest solstice is a folk ritual that incorporates this tradition and allows entire villages to experience communal goodwill by celebrating a luxurious version of this dish together.</p>\n<p>This ritual is performed over 1 hour of cooking a soup of crushed black sesame and sugar in several large cauldrons while good-natured jokes and puns praising Daikitsu, Kofusachi, and other benevolent deities are uttered; quips inspired by Hei Feng and Sun Wukong are usually included in these jovialities, for these rambunctious deities are always ready for feasts and humor. Each time a joke or pun is made, a rice ball is dropped into the boiling soups.</p>\n<p>This ritual can only be performed once each winter season. If performed on the night of the winter solstice, the DCs of the ritual's skill checks are reduced by 2.</p>\n<p>If the ritual is successful, the delicious black sesame soup, like the longest of nights, seems never-ending and even hides windfalls of chewy sweetness. Sometimes, this small mercy of hot meals, and the hope for pleasant surprises to come, is all a community needs to endure the bleakest of winters together.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spell-effects.Item.HDT5oiQXXnRdDIKR]{Spell Effect: Sweetest Solstice}</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The pot contains enough black sesame soup and rice balls to feed a hot meal to everyone in the settlement for a month.
